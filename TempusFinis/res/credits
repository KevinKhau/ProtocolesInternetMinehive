Hello there!

I am Kévin, and when offered to create a 1v1 network game application for the academic project "Protocoles des Services Internet", I opted for this more ambitious game : a secured data-saving multiplayer network minesweeper with graphical interface...! Welcome to Minehive!
Here you can find our detailed specifications in French : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XLI8eGQcJolnbZ0rGfNKIpfikeZTyZBPQ1SF6lxbV38/edit?usp=sharing
This project was successfully completed in ~4 months (along other classes, of course).

Special thanks to my partner Tomek and the whole Moghive team :
Tempus Finis -> Kévin Khau, Tomek Lecocq
Milites -> Adil Champion, Aylin Kocoglu
Caetuna -> Valloris Cylly, Somaya Ben Khemis
